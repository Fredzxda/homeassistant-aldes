# Aldes integration for Home Assistant

This integration allows Home Assistant to fetch and modify data from Aldes products through an AldesConnect box.

## Supported products

### T.OneÂ® AIR

#### Implemented

+ Binary sensor entity to check if the product is connected to Aldes cloud
+ Temperature sensor entities for each room
+ Climate entities for each room that allow to set the target temperature

#### To do

+ Air cooling mode is not implemented yet since I still need to activate the feature

### Other products

I can't develop support for other products since I don't have them. But you can always submit a PR!

## Installation

This integration is available through HACS.

The username and password asked during the configuration are the same that you use for the Aldes mobile app.

## Development

This integration is based on https://github.com/custom-components/integration_blueprint
