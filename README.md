# Aldes integration for Home Assistant

This integration allows Home Assistant to fetch and modify data from Aldes products through an AldesConnect box.

**Warning:** This integration is barely usable, given AldesConnect deep connectivity issues, even with the official mobile app (see the PlayStore comments for instance). Also, the API lacks several important features which makes this integration a lesser one.

## Supported products

### T.OneÂ® AIR
### EASYHOME PureAir Compact CONNECT

#### Implemented

+ Binary sensor entity to check if the product is connected to Aldes cloud
+ Temperature sensor entities for each room
+ Additional sensors (including humidity and temperature for Controlled Mechanical Ventilation as well as Air quality)
+ Climate entities for each room that allow to set the target temperature
+ Select entity to change Controlled Mechanical Ventilation mode between Halidays, Daily, Boost, Guest, Air prog.

#### To do

+ Air cooling mode is not implemented yet since I still need to activate the feature

### Other products

I can't develop support for other products since I don't have them. But you can always submit a PR!

## Installation

This integration is available through HACS.
